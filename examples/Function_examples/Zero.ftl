[number/-s]

Signature.
A natural number is a notion. with constructor - | - | 0, n is a natural number | - | Suc n

Let i, j denote natural numbers.

Signature.
i + j is a natural number.

Axiom.
i + 0 = i.

Axiom.
i + Suc j = Suc (i + j).

Proposition.
For any natural number i (0 + i) = i.
Proof. Obvious.

Signature.
i < j is a relation.

Axiom.
i < Suc i.

Axiom.
Let i,j,k be natural numbers. If i < j and j < k then i < k.

Proposition.
For every natural number i (i = 0 or 0 < i).
Proof by structure induction. Obvious.

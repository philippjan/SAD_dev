Proposition.
There exists an injective function that is linear from V to dual(dual(V)).
Proof.
Define f = \v in Cr(V). \g in Cr(dual(V)). g[v].
Let us show that f is an injective function that is linear from V to dual(dual(V)).
	Let us show that f is linear from V to dual(dual(V)).
		f is from Cr(V) to Cr(dual(dual(V))).
		proof.
			Dom(f) = Cr(V).
			Let x be an element of Cr(V).
			f[x] is a scalar function on dual(V).
			proof.
				Dom(f[x]) = Cr(dual(V)) and for every element y of Cr(dual(V)) f[x][y] is a scalar.
				For all elements h,g of Cr(dual(V)) f[x][add(dual(V))[(h,g)]] = f[x][h] + f[x][g].
				proof.
					Let h,g be elements of Cr(dual(V)).
					f[x][add(dual(V))[(h,g)]] = add(dual(V))[(h,g)][x] = h[x] + g[x] = f[x][h] + f[x][g]. 
				end.
				For every element g of Cr(dual(V)) and every scalar a f[x][scm(dual(V))[(a,g)]] = a * f[x][g].
				proof.
					Let g be an element of Cr(dual(V)). Let a be a scalar.
					f[x][scm(dual(V))[(a,g)]] = scm(dual(V))[(a,g)][x] = a * g[x] = a * f[x][g].
				end.
			end.
		end.
		For all elements x,y of Cr(V) f[add(V)[(x,y)]] = add(dual(dual(V)))[(f[x], f[y])].
		proof.
			Let x,y be elements of Cr(V). add(dual(dual(V)))[(f[x], f[y])] is an element of Cr(dual(dual(V))).
			Therefore add(dual(dual(V)))[(f[x], f[y])] is a function. f [add(V)[(x,y)]] is a function.
			Dom (f [add(V)[(x,y)]]) = Cr(dual(V)) = Dom(add(dual(dual(V)))[(f[x], f[y])]).
			For every element g of Cr(dual(V)) we have (f [add(V)[(x,y)]])[g] = (add(dual(dual(V)))[(f[x], f[y])])[g].
			Therefore the thesis (by FunExt).
		end.
		For every scalar a and every element x of Cr(V) f[scm(V) [(a,x)]] = scm(dual(dual(V)))[(a,f[x])].
		proof.
			Let a be a scalar and x be an element of Cr(V). f[scm(V) [(a,x)]] and scm(dual(dual(V)))[(a,f[x])] are functions.
			Dom(f[scm(V) [(a,x)]]) = Cr(dual(V)) = Dom(scm(dual(dual(V)))[(a,f[x])]).
			For every element g of Cr(dual(V)) we have f[scm(V) [(a,x)]][g] = scm(dual(dual(V)))[(a,f[x])][g].
			Therefore the thesis (by FunExt).
		end.

	end.
	Let us show that f is injective.
		Let x,y be elements of Dom(f). Assume x != y. Take a scalar function g on V such that g[x] != g[y] (by Exi).
		Then f[x][g] != f[y][g].
	end.

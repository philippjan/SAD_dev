[ideal/-s]

Definition DefIdeal.
    An ideal is a set X such that for every x << X
        forall y << X (x + y) << X and
        forall z (z * x) << X.

Let I,J denote ideals.

Lemma IdeSum.   I +' J is an ideal.
Proof.
    Let x, y belong to I +' J and z be an element.
    Take k << I and l << J such that x = k + l (by DefSSum).
    Take m << I and n << J such that y = m + n (by DefSSum).
    k + m belongs to I and l + n belongs to J.
    z * k belongs to I and z * l belongs to J.
    We have x + y = (k + m) + (l + n) (by AddComm, AddAsso).
    We have z * x = (z * k) + (z * l) (by AMDistr).
    Hence (x + y), (z * x) belong to I +' J.

        w = x (mod I) and w = y (mod J).
Proof.
    Take a << I and b << J such that a + b = 1.
    Take w = (y * a) + (x * b).

    w - x belongs to I.
    proof.
        w - x = (y * a) + ((x * b) - x) (by AddAsso).
        x * (b - 1) belongs to I.
    end.

    w - y belongs to J.
    proof.
        w - y = (x * b) + ((y * a) - y) (by AddAsso,AddComm).
        y * (a - 1) belongs to J.

Definition DefDiv.

Definition DefPrIdeal.
    Let c be an element. <c> is { c * x | x is an element }.

Proof.
    Let x,y belong to <c> and z be an element.
    Take an element u such that c * u = x.
    Take an element v such that c * v = y.
    We have x + y = c * (u + v) (by AMDistr).
    We have z * x = c * (u * z) (by MulComm,MulAsso).
    Hence (x + y), (z * x) belong to <c>.

Theorem GCDin.  Let a, b be elements.
    Assume that a is nonzero or b is nonzero.
    Let c be a gcd of a and b. Then c belongs to <a> +' <b>.
Proof.
    Take an ideal I equal to <a> +' <b>.
    We have 0,a << <a> and 0,b << <b>.
    Hence there exists a nonzero element of <a> +' <b>.

    Take a nonzero u << I
        such that for no nonzero v << I (|v| -<- |u|).
    Indeed we can show by induction on |w| that
        for every nonzero w << I there exists nonzero u << I
            such that for no nonzero v << I (|v| -<- |u|).
        Obvious.

    u is a common divisor of a and b.
    proof.
        Assume the contrary.
        For some elements x,y  u = (a * x) + (b * y).
        proof.
            Take k << <a> and l << <b> such that u = k + l.
            Hence the thesis.
        end.

        Case u does not divide a.
            Take elements q,r such that a = (q * u) + r
                and (r = 0 \/ |r| -<- |u|).
            r is nonzero.
            - (q * u) belongs to I.
            a belongs to I.
            r = - (q * u) + a.
            Hence r belongs to I.
        end.

        Case u does not divide b.
            Take elements q,r such that b = (q * u) + r
                and (r = 0 \/ |r| -<- |u|).
            r is nonzero.
            - (q * u) belongs to I.
            b belongs to I.
            r = - (q * u) + b.
            Hence r belongs to I.
        end.
    end.

    Hence u divides c.
    Hence the thesis.

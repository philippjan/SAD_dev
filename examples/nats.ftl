[number/-s]
Signature. A natural number is a notion.

Signature. 0 is a natural number.

Let n,m stand for natural numbers.

Signature. n + m is a natural number. 

Axiom. n + 0 = n.

Signature. Succ n is a natural number.

Axiom. n + (Succ m) = Succ(n + m).

Signature. n -<- m is an atom.

Axiom.
n -<- Succ n.

Axiom. Assume n != 0. There exists a natural number m such that n = Succ m.

Proposition.For every natural number n  0 + n = n.
Proof by induction. Let n be a natural number. qed.


Axiom.
Succ n != 0.

Proposition. n != 0 => n + m != 0. Proof.
Assume that n!= 0. qed.

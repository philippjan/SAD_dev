Definition ArSeq.   ArSeq(a,q) = { integer b | b = a (mod q) }.

Definition Open.    A is open iff for any a << A
                        there exists q such that ArSeq(a,q) [= A.

Definition Closed.  A is closed iff ~A is open.

Definition OpenIntegerSets.
An open family is a family of integer sets S such that every element of S is open.

Lemma UnionOpen.   Let S be an open family.
                    \-/ S is open.
Proof.
 Let x << \-/ S. Take a set M such that( M is an element of S and x << M). Take q such that ArSeq(x,q) [= M.
 Then ArSeq(x,q) [= \-/ S.

Lemma InterOpen.    Let A,B be open subsets of INT. Then A /-\ B is a subset of INT and
                    A /-\ B is open.
Proof.
A /-\ B is a subset of INT. Let x << A /-\ B. Then x is an integer. Take q such that ArSeq(x,q) [= A. Take p such that ArSeq(x,p) [= B.
Let us show that p*q is a nonzero integer and ArSeq(x, p * q) [= A /-\ B. p*q is a nonzero integer.
  Let a << ArSeq(x, p * q). a << ArSeq (x, p) and a << ArSeq (x, q). proof. x is an integer and a = x (mod p * q). a = x (mod p) and a = x (mod q) (by EquModMul).end.
  Therefore a << A and a << B. Hence a << A /-\ B. end.

                        all elements of S are closed subsets of INT.
                    \-/ S is closed.

Lemma ArSeqClosed.  ArSeq(a,q) is a closed subset of INT.
Proof.
ArSeq (a,q) is a subset of INT.
Let b << ~ArSeq (a,q). Let us show that ArSeq(b,q) [= ~ArSeq(a,q).
  Let c << ArSeq(b,q). Assume not c << ~ArSeq(a,q). Then c = b (mod q) and a = c (mod q).
  Hence b = a (mod q). Therefore b << ArSeq(a,q). Contradiction. end.

Theorem Fuerstenberg.   Let S = { ArSeq(0,r) | r is a prime }.
                        S is infinite.
Proof.
    S is a family of integer sets.
    We have ~ \-/ S = {1, -1}.
    proof.
        Let us show that for any integer n n belongs to \-/ S iff n has a prime divisor. Let n be an integer.
        If n has a prime divisor then n belongs to \-/ S.
        proof.
        Assume n has a prime divisor. Take a prime divisor p of n.
        ArSeq(0,p) << S. n << ArSeq(0,p). end.
        If n belongs to \-/ S then n has a prime divisor.
        proof.
        Assume n belongs to \-/S. Take a prime r such that n << ArSeq(0,r).
        Then r is a prime divisor of n. end.
        end.
    end.

    Assume that S is finite.
    Then \-/ S is closed and ~ \-/ S is open.

    Take p such that ArSeq(1,p) [= ~ \-/ S.
    ArSeq(1,p) has an element x such that neither x = 1 nor x = -1.
    proof.
        1 + p and 1 - p belong to ArSeq(1,p).
        1 + p !=  1 /\ 1 - p !=  1.
        1 + p != -1 \/ 1 - p != -1.
    end.
    We have a contradiction.
